# Project-Code
The code implementation begins with the simulation for a single layer of anti-reflection coating, followed by the multi-layer coating setup. 
Next, the code introducing a single phase shift is provided. 
Lastly, the simulation for multi-layers with gain is uploaded.
Each script includes clearly defined parameters, with relevant terminologies explained through comments in the single-layer code.
Following these, the grating structure code—which this dissertation aims to replicate—is also uploaded. 
Since the variable names differ in this file, descriptive comments have been added alongside each variable for clarity.
All codes are flexible and can be modified by the user as needed by adjusting the parameter values.
The mathematical equations applied in these simulations are referenced in the Background Theory and Methodology sections of this dissertation.
